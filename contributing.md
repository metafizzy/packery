## Submitting issues

### Reduced test case required

All bug reports and problem issues require a [**reduced test case**](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/). Create one by forking any one of the [CodePen examples](http://codepen.io/desandro/tag/packery-docs) from [the docs](http://packery.metafizzy.co).

+ A reduced test case clearly demonstrates the bug or issue.
+ It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.
+ A link to your production site is **not** a reduced test case.

Providing a reduced test case is the best way to get your issue addressed. Without a reduced test case, your issue may be closed.
